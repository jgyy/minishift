# Minishift

Stores the cloudformation script to spin up aws instances for minishift and gitlab. Note that this will cost at least 1USD per day.

## Notes

This repository will store my personal scripts that will spin up various devops tools via ec2 instances. Containers will not be used for the time being other than openshift.

## TODO

Refactor the script so that it can deploy different applications
